# Container

<h2> Task 1: Class Implementation </h2>

Design a class called Container that can be used to store a set of elements in the list attribute
(e.g. numbers, text, letter and etc). The class initially was designed to store a set of integer numbers
that not more than 50 elements. Due to the limitations of design, you have to redesign the class into
a template class so that the list element data type will not fix during the design time of the class.
Container
- list:int *
+ Box(int)

<h2> Task 2: </h2>
Implement three (3) utility methods (exclude constructor and destructor methods) that could be
useful in the Container class to provide the basic operations for the class. You must explain the
logic for each implemented methods clearly in your report.

<h2> Task 3: </h2>
Create a driver program to exercise the Container template class. Create two (2) Container
objects and store two (2) different data (e.g. int, double or string). Exercise the methods that
implemented in the task 2.
